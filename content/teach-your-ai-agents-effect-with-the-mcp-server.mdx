## Guideline

To enable AI coding agents (like Cursor or custom bots) to provide highly accurate, context-aware assistance for your Effect application, run the **Effect MCP (Meta-Circular-Protocol) server**. This tool exposes your application's entire dependency graph and service structure in a machine-readable format.

---

## Rationale

AI coding agents are powerful, but they often lack the deep, structural understanding of a complex Effect application. They might not know which services are available in the context, what a specific `Layer` provides, or how your feature modules are composed.

The MCP server solves this problem. It's a specialized server that runs alongside your application during development. It inspects your `AppLayer` and creates a real-time, queryable model of your entire application architecture.

An AI agent can then connect to this MCP server to ask specific questions before generating code, such as:
-   "What services are available in the current context?"
-   "What is the full API of the `UserService`?"
-   "What errors can `UserRepository.findById` fail with?"

By providing this live, ground-truth context, you transform your AI from a generic coding assistant into a specialized expert on *your* specific codebase, resulting in far more accurate and useful code generation and refactoring.

---

## Good Example

The "Good Example" is the workflow this pattern enables.

1.  **You run the MCP server** in your terminal, pointing it at your main `AppLayer`.
    ```bash
    npx @effect/mcp-server --layer src/layers.ts:AppLayer
    ```

2.  **You configure your AI agent** (e.g., Cursor) to use the MCP server's endpoint (`http://localhost:3333`).

3.  **You ask the AI a question** that requires deep context about your app:
    > "Refactor this code to use the `UserService` to fetch a user by ID and log the result with the `Logger`."

4.  **The AI, in the background, queries the MCP server:**
    -   It discovers that `UserService` and `Logger` are available in the `AppLayer`.
    -   It retrieves the exact method signature for `UserService.getUser` and `Logger.log`.

5.  **The AI generates correct, context-aware code** because it's not guessing; it's using the live architectural information provided by the MCP server.

```typescript
// The AI generates this correct code:
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { UserService } from "./features/User/UserService.js";
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const userService = yield* UserService;

  const user = yield* userService.getUser("123");
  yield* Effect.log(`Found user: ${user.name}`);
});

```

## Anti-Pattern

Working with an AI agent without providing it with specific context. The agent will be forced to guess based on open files or generic knowledge. This often leads to it hallucinating method names, getting dependency injection wrong, or failing to handle specific error types, requiring you to manually correct its output and defeating the purpose of using an AI assistant.
