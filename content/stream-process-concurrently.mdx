## Guideline

To process items in a stream concurrently, use `Stream.mapEffect` and provide a value greater than 1 to its `concurrency` option.

---

## Rationale

For many data pipelines, the most time-consuming step is performing an I/O-bound operation for each item, such as calling an API or querying a database. Processing these items one by one (sequentially) is safe but slow, as the entire pipeline waits for each operation to complete before starting the next.

`Stream.mapEffect`'s `concurrency` option is the solution. It provides a simple, declarative way to introduce controlled parallelism into your pipeline.

1.  **Performance Boost**: It allows the stream to work on multiple items at once, drastically reducing the total execution time for I/O-bound tasks.
2.  **Controlled Parallelism**: Unlike `Promise.all` which runs everything at once, you specify the *exact* number of concurrent operations. This is crucial for stability, as it prevents your application from overwhelming downstream services or exhausting its own resources (like file handles or network sockets).
3.  **Automatic Backpressure**: The stream will not pull new items from the source faster than the concurrent slots can process them. This backpressure is handled automatically, preventing memory issues.
4.  **Structured Concurrency**: It's fully integrated with Effect's runtime. If any concurrent operation fails, all other in-flight operations for that stream are immediately and reliably interrupted, preventing wasted work and ensuring clean shutdowns.

## Good Example

This example processes four items, each taking one second. By setting `concurrency: 2`, the total runtime is approximately two seconds instead of four, because items are processed in parallel pairs.

```typescript
import { Effect, Stream } from 'effect';

// A mock function that simulates a slow I/O operation
const processItem = (id: number): Effect.Effect<string, Error> =>
  Effect.log(`Starting item ${id}...`).pipe(
    Effect.delay('1 second'),
    Effect.map(() => `Finished item ${id}`),
    Effect.tap(Effect.log)
  );

const ids = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const program = Stream.fromIterable(ids).pipe(
  // Process up to 2 items concurrently
  Stream.mapEffect(processItem, { concurrency: 2 }),
  Stream.runDrain
);

// Measure the total time taken
const timedProgram = Effect.timed(program);

const programWithLogging = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const [duration, _] = yield* timedProgram;
  const durationMs = Number(duration);
  yield* Effect.log(`\nTotal time: ${Math.round(durationMs / 1000)} seconds`);
  return duration;
}).pipe(
  Effect.catchAll((error) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* Effect.logError(`Program error: ${error}`);
      return null;
    })
  )
);

Effect.runPromise(programWithLogging);
/*
Output:
... level=INFO msg="Starting item 1..."
... level=INFO msg="Starting item 2..."
... level=INFO msg="Finished item 1"
... level=INFO msg="Starting item 3..."
... level=INFO msg="Finished item 2"
... level=INFO msg="Starting item 4..."
... level=INFO msg="Finished item 3"
... level=INFO msg="Finished item 4"

Total time: 2 seconds
*/
```

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is to process I/O-bound tasks sequentially. This is the default behavior of `Stream.mapEffect` if you don't specify a concurrency level, and it leads to poor performance.

```typescript
import { Effect, Stream } from 'effect';
// ... same processItem function ...

const ids = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// Processing sequentially (default concurrency is 1)
const program = Stream.fromIterable(ids).pipe(
  Stream.mapEffect(processItem), // No concurrency option
  Stream.runDrain
);

const timedProgram = Effect.timed(program);

Effect.runPromise(timedProgram).then(([duration, _]) => {
  console.log(`\nTotal time: ${Math.round(duration.millis / 1000)} seconds`);
});
/*
Output:
... level=INFO msg="Starting item 1..."
... level=INFO msg="Finished item 1"
... level=INFO msg="Starting item 2..."
... level=INFO msg="Finished item 2"
... etc.

Total time: 4 seconds
*/
```

While sequential processing is sometimes necessary to preserve order or avoid race conditions, it is a performance anti-pattern for independent, I/O-bound tasks. The concurrent approach is almost always preferable in such cases.
