## Guideline

Every `Effect` has three generic type parameters: ``Effect<A, E, R>`` which represent its three "channels":
-   **`A` (Success Channel):** The type of value the `Effect` will produce if it succeeds.
-   **`E` (Error/Failure Channel):** The type of error the `Effect` can fail with. These are expected, recoverable errors.
-   **`R` (Requirement/Context Channel):** The services or dependencies the `Effect` needs to run.

---

## Rationale

This three-channel signature is what makes Effect so expressive and safe. Unlike a ``Promise<A>`` which can only describe its success type, an ``Effect``'s signature tells you everything you need to know about a computation before you run it:
1.  **What it produces (`A`):** The data you get on the "happy path."
2.  **How it can fail (`E`):** The specific, known errors you need to handle. This makes error handling type-safe and explicit, unlike throwing generic `Error`s.
3.  **What it needs (`R`):** The "ingredients" or dependencies required to run the effect. This is the foundation of Effect's powerful dependency injection system. An `Effect` can only be executed when its `R` channel is `never`, meaning all its dependencies have been provided.

This turns the TypeScript compiler into a powerful assistant that ensures you've handled all possible outcomes and provided all necessary dependencies.

## Good Example

This function signature is a self-documenting contract. It clearly states that to get a `User`, you must provide a `Database` service, and the operation might fail with a `UserNotFoundError`.

```typescript
import { Effect, Data } from "effect";

// Define the types for our channels
interface User { readonly name: string; } // The 'A' type
class UserNotFoundError extends Data.TaggedError("UserNotFoundError") {} // The 'E' type

// Define the Database service using Effect.Service
export class Database extends Effect.Service<Database>()(
  "Database",
  {
    // Provide a default implementation
    sync: () => ({
      findUser: (id: number) =>
        id === 1
          ? Effect.succeed({ name: "Paul" })
          : Effect.fail(new UserNotFoundError())
    })
  }
) {}

// This function's signature shows all three channels
const getUser = (id: number): Effect.Effect<User, UserNotFoundError, Database> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const db = yield* Database;
    return yield* db.findUser(id);
  });

// The program will use the default implementation
const program = getUser(1);

// Run the program with the default implementation
const programWithLogging = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const result = yield* Effect.provide(program, Database.Default);
  yield* Effect.log(`Result: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`); // { name: 'Paul' }
  return result;
});

Effect.runPromise(programWithLogging);
```

## Anti-Pattern

Ignoring the type system and using generic types. This throws away all the safety and clarity that Effect provides.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// ❌ WRONG: This signature is dishonest and unsafe.
// It hides the dependency on a database and the possibility of failure.
function getUserUnsafely(id: number, db: any): Effect.Effect<any> {
  try {
    const user = db.findUser(id);
    if (!user) {
      // This will be an unhandled defect, not a typed error.
      throw new Error("User not found");
    }
    return Effect.succeed(user);
  } catch (e) {
    // This is also an untyped failure.
    return Effect.fail(e);
  }
}
```
