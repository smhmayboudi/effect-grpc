## Guideline

To create and run a web server, define your application as an `Http.App` and execute it using `Http.server.serve`, providing a platform-specific layer like `NodeHttpServer.layer`.

---

## Rationale

In Effect, an HTTP server is not just a side effect; it's a managed, effectful process. The `@effect/platform` package provides a platform-agnostic API for defining HTTP applications, while packages like `@effect/platform-node` provide the concrete implementation.

The core function `Http.server.serve(app)` takes your application logic and returns an `Effect` that, when run, starts the server. This `Effect` is designed to run indefinitely, only terminating if the server crashes or is gracefully shut down.

This approach provides several key benefits:

1.  **Lifecycle Management**: The server's lifecycle is managed by the Effect runtime. This means structured concurrency applies, ensuring graceful shutdowns and proper resource handling automatically.
2.  **Integration**: The server is a first-class citizen in the Effect ecosystem. It can seamlessly access dependencies provided by `Layer`, use `Config` for configuration, and integrate with `Logger`.
3.  **Platform Agnosticism**: By coding to the `Http.App` interface, your application logic remains portable across different JavaScript runtimes (Node.js, Bun, Deno) by simply swapping out the platform layer.

---

## Good Example

This example creates a minimal server that responds to all requests with "Hello, World!". The application logic is a simple `Effect` that returns an `Http.response`. We use `NodeRuntime.runMain` to execute the server effect, which is the standard way to launch a long-running application.

```typescript
import { Effect, Duration } from "effect";
import * as http from "http";

// Create HTTP server service
class HttpServer extends Effect.Service<HttpServer>()("HttpServer", {
  sync: () => ({
    start: () =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        const server = http.createServer(
          (req: http.IncomingMessage, res: http.ServerResponse) => {
            res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
            res.end("Hello, World!");
          }
        );

        // Add cleanup finalizer
        yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() =>
          Effect.gen(function* () {
            yield* Effect.sync(() => server.close());
            yield* Effect.logInfo("Server shut down");
          })
        );

        // Start server with timeout
        yield* Effect.async<void, Error>((resume) => {
          server.on("error", (error) => resume(Effect.fail(error)));
          server.listen(3456, "localhost", () => {
            resume(Effect.succeed(void 0));
          });
        }).pipe(
          Effect.timeout(Duration.seconds(5)),
          Effect.catchAll((error) =>
            Effect.gen(function* () {
              yield* Effect.logError(`Failed to start server: ${error}`);
              return yield* Effect.fail(error);
            })
          )
        );

        yield* Effect.logInfo("Server running at http://localhost:3456/");

        // Run for a short duration to demonstrate the server is working
        yield* Effect.sleep(Duration.seconds(3));
        yield* Effect.logInfo("Server demonstration complete");
      }),
  }),
}) {}

// Create program with proper error handling
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const server = yield* HttpServer;

  yield* Effect.logInfo("Starting HTTP server...");

  yield* server.start();
}).pipe(
  Effect.scoped // Ensure server is cleaned up properly
);

// Run the server with proper error handling
const programWithErrorHandling = Effect.provide(program, HttpServer.Default).pipe(
  Effect.catchAll((error) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* Effect.logError(`Program failed: ${error}`);
      return yield* Effect.fail(error);
    })
  )
);

Effect.runPromise(programWithErrorHandling).catch(() => {
  process.exit(1);
});

/*
To test:
1. Server will timeout after 5 seconds if it can't start
2. Server runs on port 3456 to avoid conflicts
3. Proper cleanup on shutdown
4. Demonstrates server lifecycle: start -> run -> shutdown
*/

```

## Anti-Pattern

The common anti-pattern is to use the raw Node.js `http` module directly, outside of the Effect runtime. This approach creates a disconnect between your application logic and the server's lifecycle.

```typescript
import * as http from 'http';

// Manually create a server using the Node.js built-in module.
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

// Manually start the server and log the port.
const port = 3000;
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
});
```

This imperative approach is discouraged when building an Effect application because it forfeits all the benefits of the ecosystem. It runs outside of Effect's structured concurrency, cannot be managed by its resource-safe `Scope`, does not integrate with `Layer` for dependency injection, and requires manual error handling, making it less robust and much harder to compose with other effectful logic.
