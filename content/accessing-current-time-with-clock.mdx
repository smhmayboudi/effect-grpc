## Guideline

Whenever you need to get the current time within an `Effect`, do not call `Date.now()` directly. Instead, depend on the `Clock` service and use one of its methods, such as `Clock.currentTimeMillis`.

---

## Rationale

Directly calling `Date.now()` makes your code impure and tightly coupled to the system clock. This makes testing difficult and unreliable, as the output of your function will change every time it's run.

The `Clock` service is Effect's solution to this problem. It's an abstraction for "the current time."
-   In **production**, the default `Live` `Clock` implementation uses the real system time.
-   In **tests**, you can provide the `TestClock` layer. This gives you a virtual clock that you can manually control, allowing you to set the time to a specific value or advance it by a specific duration.

This makes any time-dependent logic pure, deterministic, and easy to test with perfect precision.

---

## Good Example

This example shows a function that checks if a token is expired. Its logic depends on `Clock`, making it fully testable.

```typescript
import { Effect, Clock, Duration } from "effect";

interface Token {
  readonly value: string;
  readonly expiresAt: number; // UTC milliseconds
}

// This function is pure and testable because it depends on Clock
const isTokenExpired = (token: Token): Effect.Effect<boolean, never, Clock.Clock> =>
  Clock.currentTimeMillis.pipe(
    Effect.map((now) => now > token.expiresAt),
    Effect.tap((expired) => 
      Clock.currentTimeMillis.pipe(
        Effect.flatMap((currentTime) => 
          Effect.log(`Token expired? ${expired} (current time: ${new Date(currentTime).toISOString()})`)
        )
      )
    )
  );

// Create a test clock service that advances time
const makeTestClock = (timeMs: number): Clock.Clock => ({
  currentTimeMillis: Effect.succeed(timeMs),
  currentTimeNanos: Effect.succeed(BigInt(timeMs * 1_000_000)),
  sleep: (duration: Duration.Duration) => Effect.succeed(void 0),
  unsafeCurrentTimeMillis: () => timeMs,
  unsafeCurrentTimeNanos: () => BigInt(timeMs * 1_000_000),
  [Clock.ClockTypeId]: Clock.ClockTypeId,
});

// Create a token that expires in 1 second
const token = { value: "abc", expiresAt: Date.now() + 1000 };

// Check token expiry with different clocks
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Check with current time
  yield* Effect.log("Checking with current time...");
  yield* isTokenExpired(token);

  // Check with past time
  yield* Effect.log("\nChecking with past time (1 minute ago)...");
  const pastClock = makeTestClock(Date.now() - 60_000);
  yield* isTokenExpired(token).pipe(
    Effect.provideService(Clock.Clock, pastClock)
  );

  // Check with future time
  yield* Effect.log("\nChecking with future time (1 hour ahead)...");
  const futureClock = makeTestClock(Date.now() + 3600_000);
  yield* isTokenExpired(token).pipe(
    Effect.provideService(Clock.Clock, futureClock)
  );
});

// Run the program with default clock
Effect.runPromise(
  program.pipe(
    Effect.provideService(Clock.Clock, makeTestClock(Date.now()))
  )
);
```

---

## Anti-Pattern

Directly calling `Date.now()` inside your business logic. This creates an impure function that cannot be tested reliably without manipulating the system clock, which is a bad practice.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

interface Token { readonly expiresAt: number; }

// ❌ WRONG: This function's behavior changes every millisecond.
const isTokenExpiredUnsafely = (token: Token): Effect.Effect<boolean> =>
  Effect.sync(() => Date.now() > token.expiresAt);

// Testing this function would require complex mocking of global APIs
// or would be non-deterministic.
```
