## Guideline

To handle a data source that is split across multiple pages, use `Stream.paginateEffect` to abstract the pagination logic into a single, continuous `Stream`.

---

## Rationale

Calling paginated APIs is a classic programming challenge. It often involves writing complex, stateful, and imperative code with manual loops to fetch one page, check if there's a next page, fetch that page, and so on, all while accumulating the results. This logic is tedious to write and easy to get wrong.

`Stream.paginateEffect` elegantly solves this by declaratively modeling the pagination process:

1.  **Declarative and Stateless**: You provide a function that knows how to fetch a single page, and the `Stream` handles the looping, state management (the current page token/number), and termination logic for you. Your business logic remains clean and stateless.
2.  **Lazy and Efficient**: The stream fetches pages on demand as they are consumed. If a downstream consumer only needs the first 20 items, the stream will only make enough API calls to satisfy that need, rather than wastefully fetching all pages upfront.
3.  **Fully Composable**: The result is a standard `Stream`. This means you can pipe the continuous flow of items directly into other powerful operators like `mapEffect` for concurrent processing or `grouped` for batching, without ever thinking about page boundaries again.

## Good Example

This example simulates fetching users from a paginated API. The `fetchUsersPage` function gets one page of data and returns the next page number. `Stream.paginateEffect` uses this function to create a single stream of all users across all pages.

```typescript
import { Effect, Stream, Chunk, Option } from 'effect';

// --- Mock Paginated API ---
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

// Define FetchError as a class with a literal type tag
class FetchError {
  readonly _tag = 'FetchError' as const;
  constructor(readonly message: string) {}
}

// Helper to create FetchError instances
const fetchError = (message: string): FetchError => new FetchError(message);

const allUsers: User[] = Array.from({ length: 25 }, (_, i) => ({
  id: i + 1,
  name: `User ${i + 1}`,
}));

// This function simulates fetching a page of users from an API.
const fetchUsersPage = (
  page: number
): Effect.Effect<[Chunk.Chunk<User>, Option.Option<number>], FetchError> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const pageSize = 10;
    const offset = (page - 1) * pageSize;

    // Simulate potential API errors
    if (page < 1) {
      return yield* Effect.fail(fetchError('Invalid page number'));
    }

    const users = Chunk.fromIterable(allUsers.slice(offset, offset + pageSize));

    const nextPage =
      Chunk.isNonEmpty(users) && allUsers.length > offset + pageSize
        ? Option.some(page + 1)
        : Option.none();

    yield* Effect.log(`Fetched page ${page}`);
    return [users, nextPage];
  });

// --- The Pattern ---
// Use paginateEffect, providing an initial state (page 1) and the fetch function.
const userStream = Stream.paginateEffect(1, fetchUsersPage);

const program = userStream.pipe(
  Stream.runCollect,
  Effect.map((users) => users.length),
  Effect.tap((totalUsers) => 
    Effect.log(`Total users fetched: ${totalUsers}`)
  ),
  Effect.catchTag('FetchError', (error) => 
    Effect.succeed(`Error fetching users: ${error.message}`)
  )
);

// Run the program
const programWithLogging = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const result = yield* program;
  yield* Effect.log(`Program result: ${result}`);
  return result;
});

Effect.runPromise(programWithLogging);

/*
Output:
... level=INFO msg="Fetched page 1"
... level=INFO msg="Fetched page 2"
... level=INFO msg="Fetched page 3"
... level=INFO msg="Total users fetched: 25"
25
*/
```

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is to write manual, imperative logic to handle the pagination loop. This code is stateful, harder to read, and not composable.

```typescript
import { Effect, Chunk, Option } from 'effect';
// ... same mock API setup ...

const fetchAllUsersManually = (): Effect.Effect<Chunk.Chunk<User>, Error> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // Manual state management for results and current page
    let allFetchedUsers: User[] = [];
    let currentPage: Option.Option<number> = Option.some(1);

    // Manual loop to fetch pages
    while (Option.isSome(currentPage)) {
      const [users, nextPage] = yield* fetchUsersPage(currentPage.value);
      allFetchedUsers = allFetchedUsers.concat(Chunk.toArray(users));
      currentPage = nextPage;
    }

    return Chunk.fromIterable(allFetchedUsers);
  });

const program = fetchAllUsersManually().pipe(
  Effect.map((users) => users.length)
);

Effect.runPromise(program).then((totalUsers) => {
  console.log(`Total users fetched from all pages: ${totalUsers}`);
});
```

This manual approach is inferior because it forces you to manage state explicitly (`allFetchedUsers`, `currentPage`). The logic is contained within a single, monolithic effect that is not lazy and cannot be easily composed with other stream operators without first collecting all results. `Stream.paginateEffect` abstracts away this entire block of boilerplate code.
