# Execute Asynchronous Effects with Effect.runPromise

## Guideline

To execute an `Effect` that may be asynchronous and retrieve its result, use
`Effect.runPromise`. This should only be done at the outermost layer of your
application.

## Rationale

`Effect.runPromise` is the bridge from the Effect world to the Promise-based
world of Node.js and browsers. If the Effect succeeds, the Promise resolves;
if it fails, the Promise rejects.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

const program = Effect.succeed("Hello, World!").pipe(
  Effect.delay("1 second"),
);

const promise = Effect.runPromise(program);

const programWithLogging = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const result = yield* program;
  yield* Effect.log(result); // Logs "Hello, World!" after 1 second.
  return result;
});

Effect.runPromise(programWithLogging);
```

**Explanation:**  
`Effect.runPromise` executes your effect and returns a Promise, making it
easy to integrate with existing JavaScript async workflows.

## Anti-Pattern

Never call `runPromise` inside another `Effect` composition. Effects are
meant to be composed together *before* being run once at the end.
