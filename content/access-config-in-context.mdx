# Access Configuration from the Context

## Guideline

Inside an `Effect.gen` block, use `yield*` on your `Config` object to access the resolved, type-safe configuration values from the context.

## Rationale

This allows your business logic to declaratively state its dependency on a piece of configuration. The logic is clean, type-safe, and completely decoupled from *how* the configuration is provided.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Config, Effect, Layer } from "effect";

// Define config service
class AppConfig extends Effect.Service<AppConfig>()(
  "AppConfig",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      host: "localhost",
      port: 3000
    })
  }
) {}

// Create program that uses config
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const config = yield* AppConfig;
  yield* Effect.log(`Starting server on http://${config.host}:${config.port}`);
});

// Run the program with default config
Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.provide(program, AppConfig.Default)
);
```

**Explanation:**  
By yielding the config object, you make your dependency explicit and leverage Effect's context system for testability and modularity.

## Anti-Pattern

Passing configuration values down through multiple function arguments ("prop-drilling"). This is cumbersome and obscures which components truly need which values.
