## Guideline

When a computation can fail (e.g., a network error) or succeed but find nothing, model its return type as ``Effect<Option<A>>``. This separates the "hard failure" channel from the "soft failure" (or empty) channel.

---

## Rationale

This pattern provides a precise way to handle three distinct outcomes of an operation:

1.  **Success with a value:** `Effect.succeed(Option.some(value))`
2.  **Success with no value:** `Effect.succeed(Option.none())` (e.g., user not found)
3.  **Failure:** `Effect.fail(new DatabaseError())` (e.g., database connection lost)

By using `Option` inside the success channel of an `Effect`, you keep the error channel clean for true, unexpected, or unrecoverable errors. The "not found" case is often an expected and recoverable part of your business logic, and `Option.none()` models this perfectly.

---

## Good Example

This function to find a user can fail if the database is down, or it can succeed but find no user. The return type ``Effect.Effect<Option.Option<User>, DatabaseError>`` makes this contract perfectly clear.

````typescript
import { Effect, Option, Data } from "effect"

interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
}
class DatabaseError extends Data.TaggedError("DatabaseError") {}

// This signature is extremely honest about its possible outcomes.
const findUserInDb = (
  id: number
): Effect.Effect<Option.Option<User>, DatabaseError> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // This could fail with a DatabaseError
    const dbResult = yield* Effect.try({
      try: () => (id === 1 ? { id: 1, name: "Paul" } : null),
      catch: () => new DatabaseError()
    })

    // We wrap the potentially null result in an Option
    return Option.fromNullable(dbResult)
  })

// The caller can now handle all three cases explicitly.
const program = (id: number) =>
  findUserInDb(id).pipe(
    Effect.flatMap((maybeUser) =>
      Option.match(maybeUser, {
        onNone: () =>
          Effect.logInfo(`Result: User with ID ${id} was not found.`),
        onSome: (user) =>
          Effect.logInfo(`Result: Found user ${user.name}.`)
      })
    ),
    Effect.catchAll((error) =>
      Effect.logInfo("Error: Could not connect to the database.")
    )
  )

// Run the program with different IDs
Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // Try with existing user
    yield* Effect.logInfo("Looking for user with ID 1...")
    yield* program(1)

    // Try with non-existent user
    yield* Effect.logInfo("\nLooking for user with ID 2...")
    yield* program(2)
  })
)
````

## Anti-Pattern

A common alternative is to create a specific NotFoundError and put it in the error channel alongside other errors.

````typescript
class NotFoundError extends Data.TaggedError("NotFoundError") {}
	
	// ❌ This signature conflates two different kinds of failure.
	const findUserUnsafely = (
	  id: number,
	): Effect.Effect<User, DatabaseError | NotFoundError> => {
	  // ...
	  return Effect.fail(new NotFoundError());
	};
````

While this works, it can be less expressive. It treats a "not found" result—which might be a normal part of your application's flow—the same as a catastrophic DatabaseError. 

Using ````Effect<Option<A>>```` often leads to clearer and more precise business logic.
