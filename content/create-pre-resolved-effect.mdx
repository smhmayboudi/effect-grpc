# Create Pre-resolved Effects with succeed and fail

## Guideline

To lift a pure, already-known value into an `Effect`, use `Effect.succeed()`.
To represent an immediate and known failure, use `Effect.fail()`.

## Rationale

These are the simplest effect constructors, essential for returning static
values within functions that must return an `Effect`.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Data } from "effect"

// Create a custom error type
class MyError extends Data.TaggedError("MyError") {}

// Create a program that demonstrates pre-resolved effects
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Success effect
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Running success effect...")
  yield* Effect.gen(function* () {
    const value = yield* Effect.succeed(42)
    yield* Effect.logInfo(`Success value: ${value}`)
  })

  // Failure effect
  yield* Effect.logInfo("\nRunning failure effect...")
  yield* Effect.gen(function* () {
    // Use return yield* for effects that never succeed
    return yield* Effect.fail(new MyError())
  }).pipe(
    Effect.catchTag("MyError", (error) =>
      Effect.logInfo(`Error occurred: ${error._tag}`)
    )
  )
})

// Run the program
Effect.runPromise(program)
```

**Explanation:**  
Use `Effect.succeed` for values you already have, and `Effect.fail` for
immediate, known errors.

## Anti-Pattern

Do not wrap a static value in `Effect.sync`. While it works, `Effect.succeed`
is more descriptive and direct for values that are already available.
