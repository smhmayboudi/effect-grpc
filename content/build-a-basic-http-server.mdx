## Guideline

To build an HTTP server, create a main `AppLayer` that provides all your application's services. Compile this layer into a managed `Runtime` at startup. Use this runtime to execute an `Effect` for each incoming HTTP request, ensuring all logic is handled within the Effect system.

---

## Rationale

This pattern demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a long-running Effect application.
1.  **Setup Phase:** You define all your application's dependencies (database connections, clients, config) in `Layer`s and compose them into a single `AppLayer`.
2.  **Runtime Creation:** You use `Layer.toRuntime(AppLayer)` to create a highly-optimized `Runtime` object. This is done *once* when the server starts.
3.  **Request Handling:** For each incoming request, you create an `Effect` that describes the work to be done (e.g., parse request, call services, create response).
4.  **Execution:** You use the `Runtime` you created in the setup phase to execute the request-handling `Effect` using `Runtime.runPromise`.

This architecture ensures that your request handling logic is fully testable, benefits from structured concurrency, and is completely decoupled from the server's setup and infrastructure.

---

## Good Example

This example creates a simple server with a `Greeter` service. The server starts, creates a runtime containing the `Greeter`, and then uses that runtime to handle requests.

```typescript
import { HttpServer, HttpServerResponse } from "@effect/platform"
import { NodeHttpServer } from "@effect/platform-node"
import { Duration, Effect, Fiber, Layer } from "effect"
import { createServer } from "node:http"

// Create a server layer using Node's built-in HTTP server
const ServerLive = NodeHttpServer.layer(() => createServer(), { port: 3001 })

// Define your HTTP app (here responding "Hello World" to every request)
const app = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Received HTTP request")
  return yield* HttpServerResponse.text("Hello World")
})

const serverLayer = HttpServer.serve(app).pipe(Layer.provide(ServerLive));

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Server starting on http://localhost:3001")
  const fiber = yield* Layer.launch(serverLayer).pipe(Effect.fork)
  yield* Effect.sleep(Duration.seconds(2))
  yield* Fiber.interrupt(fiber)
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Server shutdown complete")
})

Effect.runPromise(program as unknown as Effect.Effect<void, unknown, never>);
```

---

## Anti-Pattern

Creating a new runtime or rebuilding layers for every single incoming request. This is extremely inefficient and defeats the purpose of Effect's `Layer` system.

```typescript
import * as http from "http";
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";
import { GreeterLive } from "./somewhere";

// ❌ WRONG: This rebuilds the GreeterLive layer on every request.
const server = http.createServer((_req, res) => {
  const requestEffect = Effect.succeed("Hello!").pipe(
    Effect.provide(GreeterLive), // Providing the layer here is inefficient
  );
  Effect.runPromise(requestEffect).then((msg) => res.end(msg));
});
```
