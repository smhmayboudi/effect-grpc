# Leverage Effect's Built-in Structured Logging

## Guideline

Use the built-in `Effect.log*` family of functions for all application logging
instead of using `console.log`.

## Rationale

Effect's logger is structured, context-aware (with trace IDs), configurable
via `Layer`, and testable. It's a first-class citizen, not an unmanaged
side-effect.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

const program = Effect.logDebug("Processing user", { userId: 123 });

// Run the program with debug logging enabled
Effect.runSync(
  program.pipe(
    Effect.tap(() => Effect.log("Debug logging enabled"))
  )
);
```

**Explanation:**  
Using Effect's logging system ensures your logs are structured, filterable,
and context-aware.

## Anti-Pattern

Calling `console.log` directly within an Effect composition. This is an
unmanaged side-effect that bypasses all the benefits of Effect's logging system.
