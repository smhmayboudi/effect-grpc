# Creating from Synchronous and Callback Code

## Guideline

Use the `sync` and `async` constructors to lift synchronous or callback-based computations into the Effect world.  
This enables safe, composable interop with legacy or third-party code that doesn't use Promises or Effects.

## Rationale

Many APIs are synchronous or use callbacks instead of Promises.  
By lifting them into Effects, you gain access to all of Effect's combinators, error handling, and resource safety.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// Synchronous: Wrap a computation that is guaranteed not to throw
const effectSync = Effect.sync(() => Math.random()); // Effect<never, number, never>

// Callback-based: Wrap a Node.js-style callback API
function legacyReadFile(
  path: string,
  cb: (err: Error | null, data?: string) => void
) {
  setTimeout(() => cb(null, "file contents"), 10);
}

const effectAsync = Effect.async<string, Error>((resume) => {
  legacyReadFile("file.txt", (err, data) => {
    if (err) resume(Effect.fail(err));
    else if (data) resume(Effect.succeed(data));
  });
}); // Effect<string, Error, never>

```

**Explanation:**  
- `Effect.sync` is for synchronous computations that are guaranteed not to throw.
- `Effect.async` is for integrating callback-based APIs, converting them into Effects.

## Anti-Pattern

Directly calling synchronous or callback-based APIs inside Effects without lifting them, which can break composability and error handling.
