# Create a Managed Runtime for Scoped Resources

## Guideline

For services that manage resources needing explicit cleanup (e.g., a database
connection), define them in a `Layer` using `Layer.scoped`. Then, use
`Layer.launch` to provide this layer to your application.

## Rationale

`Layer.launch` is designed for resource safety. It acquires all resources,
provides them to your effect, and—crucially—guarantees that all registered
finalizers are executed upon completion or interruption.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";

class DatabasePool extends Effect.Service<DatabasePool>()(
  "DbPool",
  {
    effect: Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* Effect.log("Acquiring pool");
      return {
        query: () => Effect.succeed("result")
      };
    })
  }
) {}

// Create a program that uses the DatabasePool service
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const db = yield* DatabasePool;
  yield* Effect.log("Using DB");
  yield* db.query();
});

// Run the program with the service implementation
Effect.runPromise(
  program.pipe(
    Effect.provide(DatabasePool.Default),
    Effect.scoped
  )
);
```

**Explanation:**  
`Layer.launch` ensures that resources are acquired and released safely, even
in the event of errors or interruptions.

## Anti-Pattern

Do not use `Layer.toRuntime` with layers that contain scoped resources. This
will acquire the resource, but the runtime has no mechanism to release it,
leading to resource leaks.
