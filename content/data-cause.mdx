# Handle Unexpected Errors by Inspecting the `Cause`

## Guideline

Use the `Cause<E>` data type to get rich, structured information about errors and failures in your Effects.  
`Cause` captures not just expected errors, but also defects (unhandled exceptions), interruptions, and error traces.

## Rationale

Traditional error handling often loses information about *why* a failure occurred.  
`Cause` preserves the full error context, enabling advanced debugging, error reporting, and robust recovery strategies.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Cause, Effect } from "effect";

// An Effect that may fail with an error or defect
const program = Effect.try({
  try: () => {
    throw new Error("Unexpected failure!");
  },
  catch: (err) => err,
});

// Catch all causes and inspect them
const handled = program.pipe(
  Effect.catchAllCause((cause) =>
    Effect.sync(() => {
      if (Cause.isDie(cause)) {
        console.error("Defect (die):", Cause.pretty(cause));
      } else if (Cause.isFailure(cause)) {
        console.error("Expected error:", Cause.pretty(cause));
      } else if (Cause.isInterrupted(cause)) {
        console.error("Interrupted:", Cause.pretty(cause));
      }
      // Handle or rethrow as needed
    })
  )
);

```

**Explanation:**  
- `Cause` distinguishes between expected errors (`fail`), defects (`die`), and interruptions.
- Use `Cause.pretty` for human-readable error traces.
- Enables advanced error handling and debugging.

## Anti-Pattern

Catching only expected errors and ignoring defects or interruptions, which can lead to silent failures, missed bugs, and harder debugging.
