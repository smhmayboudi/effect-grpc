    Use Stream.runDrain to execute a stream for its side effects when you don't
    need the final values.

## Guideline

To run a stream purely for its side effects without accumulating the results in memory, use the `Stream.runDrain` sink.

---

## Rationale

Not all pipelines are designed to produce a final list of values. Often, the goal is to perform an action for each item—write it to a database, send it to a message queue, or log it to a file. In these "fire and forget" scenarios, collecting the results is not just unnecessary; it's a performance anti-pattern.

`Stream.runDrain` is the perfect tool for this job:

1.  **Memory Efficiency**: This is its primary advantage. `runDrain` processes each item and then immediately discards it, resulting in constant, minimal memory usage. This makes it the only safe choice for processing extremely large or infinite streams.
2.  **Clarity of Intent**: Using `runDrain` clearly communicates that you are interested in the successful execution of the stream's effects, not in its output values. The final `Effect` it produces resolves to `void`, reinforcing that no value is returned.
3.  **Performance**: By avoiding the overhead of allocating and managing a growing list in memory, `runDrain` can be faster for pipelines with a very large number of small items.

---

## Good Example

This example creates a stream of tasks. For each task, it performs a side effect (logging it as "complete"). `Stream.runDrain` executes the pipeline, ensuring all logs are written, but without collecting the `void` results of each logging operation.

```typescript
import { Effect, Stream } from 'effect';

const tasks = ['task 1', 'task 2', 'task 3'];

// A function that performs a side effect for a task
const completeTask = (task: string): Effect.Effect<void, never> =>
  Effect.log(`Completing ${task}`);

const program = Stream.fromIterable(tasks).pipe(
  // For each task, run the side-effectful operation
  Stream.mapEffect(completeTask, { concurrency: 1 }),
  // Run the stream for its effects, discarding the `void` results
  Stream.runDrain
);

const programWithLogging = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* program;
  yield* Effect.log('\nAll tasks have been processed.');
});

Effect.runPromise(programWithLogging);
/*
Output:
... level=INFO msg="Completing task 1"
... level=INFO msg="Completing task 2"
... level=INFO msg="Completing task 3"

All tasks have been processed.
*/
```

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is using `Stream.runCollect` when you only care about the side effects. This needlessly consumes memory and can lead to crashes.

```typescript
import { Effect, Stream } from 'effect';
// ... same tasks and completeTask function ...

const program = Stream.fromIterable(tasks).pipe(
  Stream.mapEffect(completeTask, { concurrency: 1 }),
  // Anti-pattern: Collecting results that we are just going to ignore
  Stream.runCollect
);

Effect.runPromise(program).then((results) => {
  // The `results` variable here is a Chunk of `[void, void, void]`.
  // It served no purpose but consumed memory.
  console.log(
    `\nAll tasks processed. Unnecessarily collected ${results.length} empty results.`
  );
});
```

While this works for a small array of three items, it's a dangerous habit. If the `tasks` array contained millions of items, this code would create a `Chunk` with millions of `void` values, consuming a significant amount of memory for no reason and potentially crashing the application. `Stream.runDrain` avoids this problem entirely.
