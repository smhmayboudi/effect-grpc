## Guideline

To test a piece of code in isolation, identify its service dependencies and provide mock implementations for them using a test-specific `Layer`. The most common way to create a mock layer is with `Layer.succeed(ServiceTag, mockImplementation)`.

---

## Rationale

The primary goal of a unit test is to verify the logic of a single unit of code, independent of its external dependencies. Effect's dependency injection system is designed to make this easy and type-safe.

By providing a mock `Layer` in your test, you replace a real dependency (like an `HttpClient` that makes network calls) with a fake one that returns predictable data. This provides several key benefits:
-   **Determinism:** Your tests always produce the same result, free from the flakiness of network or database connections.
-   **Speed:** Tests run instantly without waiting for slow I/O operations.
-   **Type Safety:** The TypeScript compiler ensures your mock implementation perfectly matches the real service's interface, preventing your tests from becoming outdated.
-   **Explicitness:** The test setup clearly documents all the dependencies required for the code to run.

## Good Example

We want to test a `Notifier` service that uses an `EmailClient` to send emails. In our test, we provide a mock `EmailClient` that doesn't actually send emails but just returns a success value.

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";

// --- The Services ---
interface EmailClientService {
  send: (address: string, body: string) => Effect.Effect<void>
}

class EmailClient extends Effect.Service<EmailClientService>()(
  "EmailClient",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      send: (address: string, body: string) => 
        Effect.sync(() => Effect.log(`Sending email to ${address}: ${body}`))
    })
  }
) {}

interface NotifierService {
  notifyUser: (userId: number, message: string) => Effect.Effect<void>
}

class Notifier extends Effect.Service<NotifierService>()(
  "Notifier",
  {
    effect: Effect.gen(function* () {
      const emailClient = yield* EmailClient;
      return {
        notifyUser: (userId: number, message: string) =>
          emailClient.send(`user-${userId}@example.com`, message)
      };
    }),
    dependencies: [EmailClient.Default]
  }
) {}

// Create a program that uses the Notifier service
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.log("Using default EmailClient implementation...");
  const notifier = yield* Notifier;
  yield* notifier.notifyUser(123, "Your invoice is ready.");

  // Create mock EmailClient that logs differently
  yield* Effect.log("\nUsing mock EmailClient implementation...");
  const mockEmailClient = Layer.succeed(
    EmailClient,
    {
      send: (address: string, body: string) =>
        // Directly return the Effect.log without nesting it in Effect.sync
        Effect.log(`MOCK: Would send to ${address} with body: ${body}`)
    } as EmailClientService
  );

  // Run the same notification with mock client
  yield* Effect.gen(function* () {
    const notifier = yield* Notifier;
    yield* notifier.notifyUser(123, "Your invoice is ready.");
  }).pipe(
    Effect.provide(mockEmailClient)
  );
});

// Run the program
Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.provide(program, Notifier.Default)
);
```

---

## Anti-Pattern

Testing your business logic using the "live" implementation of its dependencies. This creates an integration test, not a unit test. It will be slow, unreliable, and may have real-world side effects (like actually sending an email).

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { NotifierLive } from "./somewhere";
import { EmailClientLive } from "./somewhere"; // The REAL email client

// ❌ WRONG: This test will try to send a real email.
it("sends a real email", () =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const notifier = yield* Notifier;
    yield* notifier.notifyUser(123, "This is a test email!");
  }).pipe(
    Effect.provide(NotifierLive),
    Effect.provide(EmailClientLive), // Using the live layer makes this an integration test
    Effect.runPromise,
  ));
```
