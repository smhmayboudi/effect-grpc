## Guideline

When you need to represent a span of time (e.g., for a delay, timeout, or schedule), use the `Duration` data type. Create durations with expressive constructors like `Duration.seconds(5)`, `Duration.minutes(10)`, or `Duration.millis(500)`.

---

## Rationale

Using raw numbers to represent time is a common source of bugs and confusion. When you see `setTimeout(fn, 5000)`, it's not immediately clear if the unit is seconds or milliseconds without prior knowledge of the API.

`Duration` solves this by making the unit explicit in the code. It provides a type-safe, immutable, and human-readable way to work with time intervals. This eliminates ambiguity and makes your code easier to read and maintain. Durations are used throughout Effect's time-based operators, such as `Effect.sleep`, `Effect.timeout`, and `Schedule`.

---

## Good Example

This example shows how to create and use `Duration` to make time-based operations clear and unambiguous.

```typescript
import { Effect, Duration } from "effect";

// Create durations with clear, explicit units
const fiveSeconds = Duration.seconds(5);
const oneHundredMillis = Duration.millis(100);

// Use them in Effect operators
const program = Effect.log("Starting...").pipe(
  Effect.delay(oneHundredMillis),
  Effect.flatMap(() => Effect.log("Running after 100ms")),
  Effect.timeout(fiveSeconds) // This whole operation must complete within 5 seconds
);

// Durations can also be compared
const isLonger = Duration.greaterThan(fiveSeconds, oneHundredMillis); // true

// Demonstrate the duration functionality
const demonstration = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.logInfo("=== Duration Demonstration ===");

  // Show duration values
  yield* Effect.logInfo(`Five seconds: ${Duration.toMillis(fiveSeconds)}ms`);
  yield* Effect.logInfo(
    `One hundred millis: ${Duration.toMillis(oneHundredMillis)}ms`
  );

  // Show comparison
  yield* Effect.logInfo(`Is 5 seconds longer than 100ms? ${isLonger}`);

  // Run the timed program
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Running timed program...");
  yield* program;

  // Show more duration operations
  const combined = Duration.sum(fiveSeconds, oneHundredMillis);
  yield* Effect.logInfo(`Combined duration: ${Duration.toMillis(combined)}ms`);

  // Show different duration units
  const oneMinute = Duration.minutes(1);
  yield* Effect.logInfo(`One minute: ${Duration.toMillis(oneMinute)}ms`);

  const isMinuteLonger = Duration.greaterThan(oneMinute, fiveSeconds);
  yield* Effect.logInfo(`Is 1 minute longer than 5 seconds? ${isMinuteLonger}`);
});

Effect.runPromise(demonstration);

```

## Anti-Pattern

Using raw numbers for time-based operations. This is ambiguous and error-prone.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// ❌ WRONG: What does '2000' mean? Milliseconds? Seconds?
const program = Effect.log("Waiting...").pipe(Effect.delay(2000));

// This is especially dangerous when different parts of an application
// use different conventions (e.g., one service uses seconds, another uses milliseconds).
// Using Duration eliminates this entire class of bugs.
```
