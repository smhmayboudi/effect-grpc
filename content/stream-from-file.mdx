## Guideline

To process a large file without consuming excessive memory, create a Node.js `Readable` stream from the file and convert it into an Effect `Stream` using `Stream.fromReadable`.

---

## Rationale

The most significant advantage of a streaming architecture is its ability to handle datasets far larger than available RAM. When you need to process a multi-gigabyte log file or CSV, loading it all into memory is not an option—it will crash your application.

The `Stream.fromReadable` constructor provides a bridge from Node.js's built-in file streaming capabilities to the Effect ecosystem. This approach is superior because:

1.  **Constant Memory Usage**: The file is read in small, manageable chunks. Your application's memory usage remains low and constant, regardless of whether the file is 1 megabyte or 100 gigabytes.
2.  **Composability**: Once the file is represented as an Effect `Stream`, you can apply the full suite of powerful operators to it: `mapEffect` for concurrent processing, `filter` for selectively choosing lines, `grouped` for batching, and `retry` for resilience.
3.  **Resource Safety**: Effect's `Stream` is built on `Scope`, which guarantees that the underlying file handle will be closed automatically when the stream finishes, fails, or is interrupted. This prevents resource leaks, a common problem in manual file handling.

---

## Good Example

This example demonstrates reading a text file, splitting it into individual lines, and processing each line. The combination of `Stream.fromReadable`, `Stream.decodeText`, and `Stream.splitLines` is a powerful and common pattern for handling text-based files.

```typescript
import { FileSystem } from '@effect/platform';
import { NodeFileSystem } from '@effect/platform-node';
import type { PlatformError } from '@effect/platform/Error';
import { Effect, Stream } from 'effect';
import * as path from 'node:path';

const processFile = (
  filePath: string,
  content: string
): Effect.Effect<void, PlatformError, FileSystem.FileSystem> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const fs = yield* FileSystem.FileSystem;

    // Write content to file
    yield* fs.writeFileString(filePath, content);

    // Create a STREAMING pipeline - reads file in chunks, not all at once
    const fileStream = fs.readFile(filePath)
      .pipe(
        // Decode bytes to text
        Stream.decodeText('utf-8'),
        // Split into lines
        Stream.splitLines,
        // Process each line
        Stream.tap((line) => Effect.log(`Processing: ${line}`))
      );

    // Run the stream to completion
    yield* Stream.runDrain(fileStream);

    // Clean up file
    yield* fs.remove(filePath);
  });

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'large-file.txt');

  yield* processFile(
    filePath,
    'line 1\nline 2\nline 3'
  ).pipe(
    Effect.catchAll((error: PlatformError) =>
      Effect.logError(`Error processing file: ${error.message}`)
    )
  );
});

Effect.runPromise(
  program.pipe(
    Effect.provide(NodeFileSystem.layer)
  ))

  /*
Output:
... level=INFO msg="Processing: line 1"
... level=INFO msg="Processing: line 2"
... level=INFO msg="Processing: line 3"
*/
```

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is to use synchronous, memory-intensive functions like `fs.readFileSync`. This approach is simple for tiny files but fails catastrophically for large ones.

```typescript
import * as fs from 'node:fs';
import * as path from 'node:path';

const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'large-file.txt');
// Create a dummy file for the example
fs.writeFileSync(filePath, 'line 1\nline 2\nline 3');

try {
  // Anti-pattern: This loads the ENTIRE file into memory as a single buffer.
  const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8');
  const lines = fileContent.split('\n');

  for (const line of lines) {
    console.log(`Processing: ${line}`);
  }
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Failed to read file:', err);
} finally {
  // Clean up the dummy file
  fs.unlinkSync(filePath);
}
```

This is a dangerous anti-pattern because:

1.  **It's a Memory Bomb**: If `large-file.txt` were 2GB and your server had 1GB of RAM, this code would immediately crash the process.
2.  **It Blocks the Event Loop**: `readFileSync` is a synchronous, blocking operation. While it's reading the file from disk, your entire application is frozen and cannot respond to any other requests.
3.  **It's Not Composable**: You get a giant string that must be processed eagerly. You lose all the benefits of lazy processing, concurrency control, and integrated error handling that `Stream` provides.
